# iti0301-2022 | Mortician ðŸ’€
This project has been made by the team *"Spooky game"*

This is a game called ***Mortician*** and it's similar to Corpse Party in a sense that this is a  
multiplayer co-op horror game where you have to finish certain quests and stay alive as after some time  
a creepy monster will start chasing you and if it hits you, you die and lose. So be quick and finish the  
quests as fast as possible!
