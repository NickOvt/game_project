# iti0301-2022-backend | Mortician ğŸ’€ backend
This project has been made by the team *Spooky game*  

This is a game called Mortician and it's similar to Corpse Party in a sense that this is a
multiplayer co-op horror game where you have to finish certain quests and stay alive as after some time
a creepy monster will start chasing you and if it hits you, you die and lose. So be quick and finish the
quests as fast as possible!
